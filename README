The HOURS simulation package consists of various subpackages
The following are included in the present folder:
--The package in the folder "run1_ver4" is a front end to the GEANT4 kit
  There the particles from the generation are read, transported and the produced
  Cherenkov photons hit the PMTs. The input and output of the program is in
  evt file format (if the apropriate command line argument is used). The output
  hits correspond to the photoelectrons produced by the photocathode, 
  and the QE vs wavelength and PMT effective area vs incident angle are
  taken into account. But TTS, PMT charge responce, Threshold considerations 
  and Collection Efficiency are not included. This is done by the following
  package. The package is compiled with "make -f GNUmakefile". The program 
  is the "run1_ver4/WORK/bin/Linux-g++/KM3Sim". 
  To run it you must have set the right path to the libraries
  "LD_LIBRARY_PATH". An example running script is the
  "/sps/km3net/users/tsirigot/ORCARunDense/runsim.sh" (not batch job, just interactive run)


--The package in the folder "OmSimulation" reads the file from the previous 
  program, takes into account Collection Efficiency, TTS, PMT charge responce, 
  Threshold values, PMT pulse characteristics and produces hits. Each hit 
  is a pulse with certain charge, when this pulse is above the predefined
  threshold. The hit time is the time the rising edge of the pulse exceeds
  the threshold. Each hit may correspond to many pes.
  This package also includes in the output file hits that are produced by
  K40 noise, correlated and uncorrelated. The package is compiled by just 
  running the script "./MyCompile.sh" in the package folder. The output program 
  is called OmSim and to run it you must have set the right path to the libraries
  "LD_LIBRARY_PATH". An example running script is the 
  "/sps/km3net/users/tsirigot/ORCARunDense/runsimom.sh" (not batch job, just interactive run)

  Both of the above packages use the ANTARES package included in the folder 
  "v1r12seawiet" to read and write evt files.
  The first package uses the GEANT4 installation included in the folder 
  "geant4.9.5.p02-install"
