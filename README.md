Resurrected & trimmed version of the KM3Sim Geant4 steering library from the HOURS package.

Currently this is being trimmed down to a minimal working example, ignoring all kinds of custom EM/Hadronic parametrizations etc.

Also, this version takes advantage of the C++11 features (which is required to compile the latest Geant4).
